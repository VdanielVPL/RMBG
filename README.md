**RMBG** is a simple tool designed to remove backgrounds from images effortlessly on Windows 10/11. It utilizes **Wails** (Go backend) and the Python-based rembg CLI library for background removal. You will need **Python version 3.8 to 3.12**, along with the rembg library. The frontend is built with **React**, using **Bun** for building, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface.

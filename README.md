1. **Ensure Prerequisites are Met**:

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file to install the application.
   - After installation and ensuring that the prerequisites are met, the application is ready to use.

## 📝 Prerequisites

Before using RMBG, ensure you have the following installed:

### Option 1: Using Python and Pip

- **Python 3.10 to 3.13**: Download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **[`rembg`](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) library**: Install with:
  
  ```bash
  pip install "rembg[cli]"
  ```
  Check that it’s installed correctly:
  ```bash
  rembg
  ```
  This should show the rembg help information.

### Option 2: Using the rembg installer

- Download and run the **rembg installer** from [here](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/latest/download/rembg-cli-installer.exe).

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Usage

Once the application is installed and started:

1. **Add an Image**:
